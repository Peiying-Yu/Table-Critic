We need to know the score of each match, which is given in the \"score\" column. The scores are in the format home-team-score-away-team-score. We extract the home team score for each row and create a different column \"home team score\" for each row. The datatype is numerical. So we use f_add_column(home team score). The value: 4 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 0\n\nStep 2: Filter out useless columns.\nsimilar words of the question link to columns :\nscore -> home team score\ncolumn value of the question link to columns :\nNone\nsemantic sentence of the question link to columns :\nNone\nSo we use f_select_column(home team score).\n\nStep 3: After using f_add_column(home team score) and f_select_column(home team score), we obtain the sub table:\n/*\ncol   :  home team score\nrow 1 :  4\nrow 2 :  2\nrow 3 :  1\nrow 4 :  1\nrow 5 :  2\nrow 6 :  3\nrow 7 :  1\nrow 8 :  0\n*/\nThe average score of all home team members for all dates can be calculated by adding all the scores together and dividing by the number of rows. The sum of all scores is 17 (4+2+1+1+2+3+1+0) and there are 8 rows. Therefore, the average score is 2.125.\n\nPrediction Answer:\n2.125\n\nAnalysis:\nStep 1 makes a correct attempt at extracting the home team score from the given \"score\" column. By creating a new column and populating it with the appropriate values based on the format of the scores provided in the original table, it sets up the data in a way that can be used for further calculation related to the home team scores. Step 1 is correct.\nStep 2 effectively filters the columns to focus only on the newly created \"home team score\" column, which is the relevant data needed to calculate the average score of the home team members as asked in the question. This step is a proper way to narrow down the data for the subsequent calculation step. Step 2 is correct.\nStep 3 has a calculation error. When adding up the scores (4 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 0), the sum is indeed 14, not 17 as stated. Step 3 is incorrect.\n\nConclusion: (final query error -> <END>)"

We need to look at the rows where the competition type is \"friendly\" and check the dates to determine if they are consecutive. The relevant rows are row 1, row 2, and row 4. So we use f_select_row(row 1, row 2, row 4).\n\nStep 2: Filter out useless columns.\nsimilar words of the question link to columns :\nscored in -> goal\nconsecutive -> date\nfriendly competitions -> competition\ncolumn value link to columns :\nfriendly -> competition\nSo we use f_select_column(goal, date, competition).\n  \nStep 3: Group the column of competition. So we use f_group_column(competition).\n\nStep 4: After using f_select_row(row 1, row 2, row 4), f_select_column(goal, date, competition) and f_group_column(competition), we obtain the sub table:\n/*\ncol : goal |       date  | competition\nrow 1 : 1 | may 9, 2004 | friendly\nrow 2 : 2 | jun 26, 2005 | friendly\nrow 3 : 4 | may 12, 2007 | friendly\n*/\n/*\nGroup the rows according to column: competition.\nGroup ID | competition | Count\nGroup 1 | friendly | 3\n*/\nChalupny did not score in any consecutive friendly competitions. The gaps in dates between her goals indicate non-consecutive friendly matches.\n\nPrediction Answer:\n0\n\nAnalysis:\nRow 8 was omitted in Step 1, despite satisfying the criteria. The reasoning only considers rows 1, 2, and 4, which makes Step 1 incomplete and therefore incorrect. Step 1 is incorrect.\n\nConclusion: (sub-table error -> row error -> <END>)"

We need to locate the rows for these two teams and compare their \"promotions\" column values to determine which team had more promotions. So we use f_select_row(row 4, row 6)\n\nStep 2: Filter out useless columns.\nsimilar words of the question link to columns:\nhad the most promotions -> promotions\nbetween the two teams -> team\ncolumn value of the question link to columns:\nnuova sebastiani rieti -> team\nnew basket brindisi -> team\nsemantic sentence of the question link to columns:\nwho had the most promotions -> promotions\nSo we use f_select_column(team, promotions).\n\nStep 3: After using f_select_row(row 4, row 6) and f_select_column(team, promotions), we obtain the sub-table:\n/*\ncol   : team                   | promotions\nrow 1 : nuova sebastiani rieti | 1\nrow 2 : orlandina basket       | 1\n*/\nThe table does not include a row for \"new basket brindisi\". However, both \"nuova sebastiani rieti\" and \"orlandina basket\" have 1 promotion each. Since there is no comparison available for \"new basket brindisi\", we cannot determine if it has more promotions than \"nuova sebastiani rieti\". Based on the provided data, both teams mentioned have the same number of promotions.\n\nPrediction Answer: \nBoth \"nuova sebastiani rieti\" and \"orlandina basket\" have 1 promotion. There is no information about \"new basket brindisi\" in the table.\n\nAnalysis: \nStep 1 correctly identifies the relevant row for the team Nuova Sebastiani Rieti. However, there is an issue because the row for New Basket Brindisi (row 11) is not included in the selected rows. Step 1 is incorrect.\n\nConclusion: (sub-table error -> row error -> <END>)"

Additionally, it fails to include other rows like row 6 (founded in 1946) and row 7 (founded in 1924) as it meets the condition of being founded before 1950.
